# MPP-E1180: Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis

## First Pair Assignment
### Authors: Lars Mehwald and Daniel Salgado Moreno
### Institution: Hertie School of Governance
### Instructor: Christopher Gandrud

### Assignment Description
The first pair assignment is designed to develop your understanding of file structures, version control, and basic R data structures and descriptive statistics. Each pair will create a new public GitHub repository. The repository should be fully documented, including with a descriptive README.md file. The repository will include R source code files that access at least two core R data sets, perform basic transformations on the data, and illustrate the datas' distributions using a variety relevant of descriptive statistics. At least one file must dynamically link to another in a substantively meaningful way. Finally, another pair must make a pull request and it should be discussed and merged. Deadline 2 October, 10% of final grade.

### General Instructions
This project is organized as follows: 
Using two core data sets from R we try to applied everything learned in class. 
The data used were swiss and women. 
SwissDataSet.csv contains a Comma-separeted value file with the swiss dataset.
The DoFileSwiss.R contains a DoFile with instructions for a general work with the data set swiss. Commands used there were later used for the Markdown file. 
MarkdownTest.Rmd is a preliminary version of the final EducationAgricultureSwiss.Rmd file, which contains the final rmd code for the html and pdf documents. 

We used a Rstudio Project call PA.Rproj to save our work in R. 
HistorySwiss.Rhistory contains the complete history for the Swiss Data Set. In Addition, WorkspaceSwiss.RData saved the environment used during the work with swiss. Further analysis of the Orange data set was conducted in a seperate workspace and consequentially integrated in the GitHub repository. The same holds for the dynamically linked file (function to calculate the standard deviation of all variables of a data frame).
